# QTChess

QTChess was my final project (that never got 100% done) for my "Programming Language II" class. 

## The Project

The project had a simple concept, delevop a full chess game using QTCreator. And
try to use as much as we learned from the classes, new things (for me) such as classes,
and try to make them suitable for future hereditary usage.
Throughout the project a lot of mistakes happened, such as failures in developing
and making the logic of the game work. As of right now the project doesn't have 
logic, the game can work and will work if you dont use the logic implementantions
but the logic is still a **WIP**.

##Logic

Knight, Rook and Bishop logic are working (but not together), future implementations should
be pawn, queen and king logic. Also the chess rule of checking isn't working, you can move
another piece even if your king is under attack. So a rule should be developed aswell.
